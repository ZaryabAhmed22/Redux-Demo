1. Import the redux object with require after installing from npm. 

2. Create a store with redux.createStore().

3. Create a reducer function that takes 2 parameters as inputs and returns 1 output that's the new state snapshot

4. Call the reducer function in the redux.createStore() i.e redux.createStore(counterReducer).

5. Create a subscriber function, which is a basic js fucntion.

6. Inside the subscriber function create a variable for the latest state i.e for example const latestState = store.getState()

7. Make the redux aware of the subscriber by pointing the subscriber function inside store.subscriber(subscriberFunction).

8. Do not call the subscriber function inside the store.subscriber().

9. NOW, we will run our file with "node file.js", and it will return an error "can't read property counter(in our case, though it can be any state property) of undefined".

10. The error is given because when the reducer runs, there is no state present, so to avoid this error, we will give our reucer a default state parameter example (state = {counter: 1})

11. After fixing this problem, though running the file will give no output because we haven't dispatched any action.

12.
